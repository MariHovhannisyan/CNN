### **[Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/MariHovhannisyan/CNN/blob/master/Lab1/lab1_CNN.ipynb)**

This project builds a fully connected neural network to predict house prices based on various features from a dataset. The model is evaluated using K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure reliability and robustness.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Encoding categorical variables and scaling features
- K-Fold Cross-Validation (5-fold)
- Custom neural network architecture with:
  - Dropout
  - Batch Normalization
  - ReLU activation
- AdamW optimizer with learning rate scheduler
- Early stopping strategy
- Loss and R² score plotting per fold

### Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
